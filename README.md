# xor

### Simple neural network learning xor gate outputs


1. Neural network fed with xor gate characteristics:

0 0 -> 0
1 1 -> 0
1 0 -> 1
0 1 -> 1

2. Feeding over and over again with same input should result in NN adjusting to XOR gate characteristics

Backprop algorithm from: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html


Running main.py shows how output of networks adjusts to desired output by displaying desired output and "current"
At the end of script Pyplot chart displaying improvement of "prediction" over iterations
